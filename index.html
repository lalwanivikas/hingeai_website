<!-- FAQs Section -->
<section class="faqs">
    <h2>You've got questions, we've got answers.</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>What do I need before we start?</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>A killer Hinge profile is key – that's step one.</li>
            <li>A HingeX subscription helps heaps. You can send more likes and they get seen first. If you're game for
                dating, this one's a no-brainer.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Why should I have a HingeX subscription?</h3>
        <p>Honestly, if you can handle the 8 likes/messages per day limit on regular Hinge, you don't need us. But, to
            up your game and reach out to more folks, HingeX and us are your best pals.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use this in my city?</h3>
        <p>Totally depends on your city. Got a good number of Hinge users there? Then we're all set!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>But do I even need more matches?</h3>
        <p>Here's the thing – it's all a numbers game. Some matches might ghost, some might flake or delete the app, or
            just unmatch. To find your "the one", you gotta increase your odds.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How does signing up work?</h3>
        <p>Easy peasy! We activate accounts on Discord (all countries) or via texting (US/Canada). We'll work it out
            together. Just submit your email below, and we'll get in touch.</p>

<!-- Let's Talk Money Section -->
<section class="money">
    <h2>Let's talk money.</h2>
    <p>Life is free to play, but pay to win.</p>
    <p>We’re a premium service. Our goal? To help <i>YOU</i>, not to mess up Hinge for everyone. The higher price is
        intended to ensure that only those who are serious about dating apply. Ask yourself this: if you can't spend a
        couple of dates worth of money on something that brings you way more matches, are you really serious?</p>
    <p>And here's a promise: We <i>DON'T</i> want to keep you around for more than a couple of months. If we do, it
        means we've goofed up on our job. (Unless you're enjoying the dating scene so much, you can't leave - we totally
        get!)</p>
